= LHC Todo list =

 * Clean-up warnings.
 * Cabalise the lhc-base library.
 * Test coverage
 * QuickCheck testsuite
 * Parallisation.
 * Remove unnecessary IO.
 * Remove old cruft in favor of Hackage; e.g. we have now replaced the UTF8 and MD5 stuff with utf8-string and pureMD5
 * Replace Doc - this will make LHC much easier to build. Candidates: ansi-wl-pprint?
 * Remove the last bits of the previous build system (Makefile.am, configure.ac, etc).
 * Write a script for recreating the generated code.
 * Can we replace SHA1.hs with something from Hackage? (note: we may be able to use the Crypto package.)
 * We currently depend on stringtable-atom from hackage; we would like to delete this.
