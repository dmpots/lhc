== 0.6.*
* Removed some extern'd glibc variables that only caused build
  failures on e.g. OS X under very certain conditions.
* Rewrote variable Id situation; previously used Integers
  to essentially represent ADTs using a number scheme. We have now
  replaced this with a nice, type-safe ADT.
* No Int/Word tagging.
* Rewrote much of the base library to get it to compile
  under -flint, and now base is a bit bigger.
* Fixed many typeclass bugs and kind inference issues.
* Automated regression-suite using lhc-regress
* No longer uses autoconf etc - we have a cabal build system.
* The E simplifier is now O(n) instead of O(n^2) - this cuts down
  build time.
* Now uses the stringtable-atom package from hackage,
  although ultimately we would like to delete this dependency
  entirely.
* Now uses utf8-string from hackage.
* Now uses pureMD5 from hackage.
* Now requires binary >= 0.4.4
* We now use the derive package >= 0.1.4 instead of DrIFT,
  because derive allows us to use template haskell, thus avoiding
  a need for preprocessing.
* Now uses ansi-terminal and ansi-wl-pprint from hackage.
* We can now install the base library automatically by passing
  the -fwith-base flag to 'cabal install' - this requires cabal 1.7
  to be installed, however.
* Random code cleanups, etc.
