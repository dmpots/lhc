== 0.6.*
* No longer uses autoconf etc - we have a cabal build system.
* The E simplifier is now O(n) instead of O(n^2) - this cuts down
  build time.
* Now uses the stringtable-atom package from hackage,
  although ultimately we would like to delete this dependency
  entirely.
* Now uses utf8-string from hackage.
* Now uses pureMD5 from hackage.
* Now requires binary >= 0.4.4
* Now uses haskeline from hackage for the (dull) interactive mode
  instead of readline.
* We now use the derive package >= 0.1.4 instead of DrIFT,
  because derive allows us to use template haskell, thus avoiding
  a need for preprocessing.
* Now uses ansi-terminal and ansi-wl-pprint from hackage.
* Now requires Cabal >= 1.7 as it has LHC support, allowing us
  to install lhc's packages easily as a post-installation step.
* Random code cleanups, etc.
