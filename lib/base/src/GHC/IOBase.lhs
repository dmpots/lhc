-- The IO Monad

{-
The IO Monad is just an instance of the ST monad, where the state is
the real world.  We use the exception mechanism (in GHC.Exception) to
implement IO exceptions.

NOTE: The IO representation is deeply wired in to various parts of the
system.  The following list may or may not be exhaustive:

Compiler  - types of various primitives in PrimOp.lhs

RTS       - forceIO (StgMiscClosures.hc)
          - catchzh_fast, (un)?blockAsyncExceptionszh_fast, raisezh_fast 
            (Exceptions.hc)
          - raiseAsync (Schedule.c)

Prelude   - GHC.IOBase.lhs, and several other places including
            GHC.Exception.lhs.

Libraries - parts of hslibs/lang.

A value of type @'IO' a@ is a computation which, when performed,
does some I\/O before returning a value of type @a@.  

There is really only one way to \"perform\" an I\/O action: bind it to
@Main.main@ in your program.  When your program is run, the I\/O will
be performed.  It isn't possible to perform I\/O from an arbitrary
function, unless that function is itself in the 'IO' monad and called
at some point, directly or indirectly, from @Main.main@.

'IO' is a monad, so 'IO' actions can be combined using either the do-notation
or the '>>' and '>>=' operations from the 'Monad' class.

-- Unsafe IO operations

{-|
This is the \"back door\" into the 'IO' monad, allowing
'IO' computation to be performed at any time.  For
this to be safe, the 'IO' computation should be
free of side effects and independent of its environment.

If the I\/O computation wrapped in 'unsafePerformIO'
performs side effects, then the relative order in which those side
effects take place (relative to the main I\/O trunk, or other calls to
'unsafePerformIO') is indeterminate.  You have to be careful when 
writing and compiling modules that use 'unsafePerformIO':

  * Use @{\-\# NOINLINE foo \#-\}@ as a pragma on any function @foo@
        that calls 'unsafePerformIO'.  If the call is inlined,
        the I\/O may be performed more than once.

  * Use the compiler flag @-fno-cse@ to prevent common sub-expression
        elimination being performed on the module, which might combine
        two side effects that were meant to be separate.  A good example
        is using multiple global variables (like @test@ in the example below).

  * Make sure that the either you switch off let-floating, or that the 
        call to 'unsafePerformIO' cannot float outside a lambda.  For example, 
        if you say:
        @
           f x = unsafePerformIO (newIORef [])
        @
        you may get only one reference cell shared between all calls to @f@.
        Better would be
        @
           f x = unsafePerformIO (newIORef [x])
        @
        because now it can't float outside the lambda.

It is less well known that
'unsafePerformIO' is not type safe.  For example:

>     test :: IORef [a]
>     test = unsafePerformIO $ newIORef []
>     
>     main = do
>             writeIORef test [42]
>             bang <- readIORef test
>             print (bang :: [Char])

This program will core dump.  This problem with polymorphic references
is well known in the ML community, and does not arise with normal
monadic use of references.  There is no easy way to make it impossible
once you use 'unsafePerformIO'.  Indeed, it is
possible to write @coerce :: a -> b@ with the
help of 'unsafePerformIO'.  So be careful!
-}
unsafePerformIO :: IO a -> a
unsafePerformIO m = unsafeDupablePerformIO (noDuplicate >> m)

{-| 
This version of 'unsafePerformIO' is slightly more efficient,
because it omits the check that the IO is only being performed by a
single thread.  Hence, when you write 'unsafeDupablePerformIO',
there is a possibility that the IO action may be performed multiple
times (on a multiprocessor), and you should therefore ensure that
it gives the same results each time.
-}
{-# NOINLINE unsafeDupablePerformIO #-}
unsafeDupablePerformIO  :: IO a -> a
unsafeDupablePerformIO (IO m) = lazy (case m realWorld# of (# _, r #) -> r)

-- Why do we NOINLINE unsafeDupablePerformIO?  See the comment with
-- GHC.ST.runST.  Essentially the issue is that the IO computation
-- inside unsafePerformIO must be atomic: it must either all run, or
-- not at all.  If we let the compiler see the application of the IO
-- to realWorld#, it might float out part of the IO.

-- Why is there a call to 'lazy' in unsafeDupablePerformIO?
-- If we don't have it, the demand analyser discovers the following strictness
-- for unsafeDupablePerformIO:  C(U(AV))
-- But then consider
--      unsafeDupablePerformIO (\s -> let r = f x in 
--                             case writeIORef v r s of (# s1, _ #) ->
--                             (# s1, r #)
-- The strictness analyser will find that the binding for r is strict,
-- (becuase of uPIO's strictness sig), and so it'll evaluate it before 
-- doing the writeIORef.  This actually makes tests/lib/should_run/memo002
-- get a deadlock!  
--
-- Solution: don't expose the strictness of unsafeDupablePerformIO,
--           by hiding it with 'lazy'

{-|
'unsafeInterleaveIO' allows 'IO' computation to be deferred lazily.
When passed a value of type @IO a@, the 'IO' will only be performed
when the value of the @a@ is demanded.  This is used to implement lazy
file reading, see 'System.IO.hGetContents'.

--  A Handle is represented by (a reference to) a record 
--  containing the state of the I/O port/device. We record
--  the following pieces of info:

--    * type (read,write,closed etc.)
--    * the underlying file descriptor
--    * buffering mode 
--    * buffer, and spare buffers
--    * user-friendly name (usually the
--      FilePath used when IO.openFile was called)

-- Note: when a Handle is garbage collected, we want to flush its buffer
-- and close the OS file handle, so as to free up a (precious) resource.

-- | Haskell defines operations to read and write characters from and to files,
-- represented by values of type @Handle@.  Each value of this type is a
-- /handle/: a record used by the Haskell run-time system to /manage/ I\/O
-- with file system objects.  A handle has at least the following properties:
-- 
--  * whether it manages input or output or both;
--
--  * whether it is /open/, /closed/ or /semi-closed/;
--
--  * whether the object is seekable;
--
--  * whether buffering is disabled, or enabled on a line or block basis;
--
--  * a buffer (whose length may be zero).
--
-- Most handles will also have a current I\/O position indicating where the next
-- input or output operation will occur.  A handle is /readable/ if it
-- manages only input or both input and output; likewise, it is /writable/ if
-- it manages only output or both input and output.  A handle is /open/ when
-- first allocated.
-- Once it is closed it can no longer be used for either input or output,
-- though an implementation cannot re-use its storage while references
-- remain to it.  Handles are in the 'Show' and 'Eq' classes.  The string
-- produced by showing a handle is system dependent; it should include
-- enough information to identify the handle for debugging.  A handle is
-- equal according to '==' only to itself; no attempt
-- is made to compare the internal state of different handles for equality.
--
-- GHC note: a 'Handle' will be automatically closed when the garbage
-- collector detects that it has become unreferenced by the program.
-- However, relying on this behaviour is not generally recommended:
-- the garbage collector is unpredictable.  If possible, use explicit
-- an explicit 'hClose' to close 'Handle's when they are no longer
-- required.  GHC does not currently attempt to free up file
-- descriptors when they have run out, it is your responsibility to
-- ensure that this doesn't happen.

-- Buffers

-- The buffer is represented by a mutable variable containing a
-- record, where the record contains the raw buffer and the start/end

-- the common operation of writing (or reading) some data from (to)
-- the buffer doesn't need to modify, and hence copy, the handle
-- itself, it just updates the buffer.  

-- There will be some allocation involved in a simple hPutChar in
-- order to create the new Buffer structure (below), but this is
-- relatively small, and this only has to be done once per write
-- operation.

-- The buffer contains its size - we could also get the size by
-- calling sizeOfMutableByteArray# on the raw buffer, but that tends
-- to be rounded up to the nearest Word.

type RawBuffer = MutableByteArray# RealWorld

-- INVARIANTS on a Buffer:
--
--   * A handle *always* has a buffer, even if it is only 1 character long
--     (an unbuffered handle needs a 1 character buffer in order to support
--      hLookAhead and hIsEOF).
--   * r <= w
--   * if r == w, then r == 0 && w == 0
--   * if state == WriteBuffer, then r == 0
--   * a write buffer is never full.  If an operation
--     fills up the buffer, it will always flush it before 
--     returning.
--   * a read buffer may be full as a result of hLookAhead.  In normal

-- Buffering modes

-- | Three kinds of buffering are supported: line-buffering, 
-- block-buffering or no-buffering.  These modes have the following
-- effects. For output, items are written out, or /flushed/,
-- from the internal buffer according to the buffer mode:
--
--  * /line-buffering/: the entire output buffer is flushed
--    whenever a newline is output, the buffer overflows, 
--    a 'System.IO.hFlush' is issued, or the handle is closed.
--
--  * /block-buffering/: the entire buffer is written out whenever it
--    overflows, a 'System.IO.hFlush' is issued, or the handle is closed.
--
--  * /no-buffering/: output is written immediately, and never stored
--    in the buffer.
--
-- An implementation is free to flush the buffer more frequently,
-- but not less frequently, than specified above.
-- The output buffer is emptied as soon as it has been written out.
--
-- Similarly, input occurs according to the buffer mode for the handle:
--
--  * /line-buffering/: when the buffer for the handle is not empty,
--    the next item is obtained from the buffer; otherwise, when the
--    buffer is empty, characters up to and including the next newline
--    character are read into the buffer.  No characters are available
--    until the newline character is available or the buffer is full.
--
--  * /block-buffering/: when the buffer for the handle becomes empty,
--    the next block of data is read into the buffer.
--
--  * /no-buffering/: the next input item is read and returned.
--    The 'System.IO.hLookAhead' operation implies that even a no-buffered
--    handle may require a one-character buffer.
--
-- The default buffering mode when a handle is opened is
-- implementation-dependent and may depend on the file system object
-- which is attached to that handle.
-- For most implementations, physical files will normally be block-buffered 
-- and terminals will normally be line-buffered.

catchException used to handle the passing around of the state to the
action and the handler.  This turned out to be a bad idea - it meant
that we had to wrap both arguments in thunks so they could be entered
as normal (remember IO returns an unboxed pair...).

Now catch# has type

    catch# :: IO a -> (b -> IO a) -> IO a

(well almost; the compiler doesn't know about the IO newtype so we
have to work around that in the definition of catchException below).

\begin{code}

catchException :: Exception e => IO a -> (e -> IO a) -> IO a
catchException io handler = io{-
catchException (IO io) handler = IO $ catch# io handler'
    where handler' e = case fromException e of
                       Just e' -> unIO (handler e')
                       Nothing -> raise# e-}

catchAny :: IO a -> (forall e . Exception e => e -> IO a) -> IO a
catchAny io handler = io{-
catchAny (IO io) handler = IO $ catch# io handler'
    where handler' (SomeException e) = unIO (handler e)-}

-- | A variant of 'throw' that can only be used within the 'IO' monad.
--
-- Although 'throwIO' has a type that is an instance of the type of 'throw', the
-- two functions are subtly different:
--
-- > throw e   `seq` x  ===> throw e
-- > throwIO e `seq` x  ===> x
--
-- The first example will cause the exception @e@ to be raised,
-- whereas the second one won\'t.  In fact, 'throwIO' will only cause
-- an exception to be raised when it is used within the 'IO' monad.
-- The 'throwIO' variant should be used in preference to 'throw' to
-- raise an exception within the 'IO' monad because it guarantees
-- ordering with respect to other 'IO' operations, whereas 'throw'
-- does not.
throwIO :: Exception e => e -> IO a
throwIO e = IO (raiseIO# (toException e))
